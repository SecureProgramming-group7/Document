# Complete File Transfer Feature Implementation Guide

##  Feature Complete

The P2P chat app now has a **fully working file transfer feature**. You can truly send and receive files end to end.

##  What’s New

### 1. Real File Data Transfer

*  Socket-based file transfer service
*  Multithreaded concurrent transfers
*  Transfer progress display
*  Automatic error handling & retry

### 2. Transfer Flow

1. **Sender** selects a file and sends a transfer request
2. **Receiver** gets a confirmation dialog to accept or decline
3. On **accept**, the receiver chooses a save location
4. The **actual** file data transfer starts automatically
5. **Real-time** progress is shown
6. Both sides are **notified** when the transfer completes

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### `FileTransferService`

* Dedicated service for file transfers
* Uses a separate port (main port + 1000)
* Supports concurrent transfers
* Monitors transfer progress

#### Transfer Protocol

```
Header format: SEND:sessionId:fileName:fileSize:savePath
Data transfer: 8 KB chunked streaming
Progress: update every 80 KB
```

##  How to Use

### Send a File

1. Click the “File” button in the chat UI
2. Choose a file
3. Confirm (group or private chat)
4. Wait for the receiver to accept
5. Transfer starts automatically

### Receive a File

1. A transfer request dialog appears
2. Review file info (name, size)
3. Click **OK** to accept
4. Choose the save location
5. Receiving starts automatically

##  Save Locations

### Default

```
<user home>/P2PChat_Downloads/
```

### Custom

* Pick any location when accepting
* Auto-rename to avoid overwrites
* Directories created automatically

##  Performance

### Throughput

* **Buffer:** 8 KB
* **Progress:** every 80 KB
* **Concurrency:** multiple files at once
* **Memory:** streaming I/O (low footprint)

### Error Handling

* Auto-detect network interruptions
* Clear “file not found” messages
* Low disk space warnings
* Automatic failure notifications

##  Debug Logs

During transfer you’ll see logs like:

```
[FileTransfer] Start sending to Node-xxx (localhost:9081)
[FileTransfer] Progress: 25% (2048/8192 bytes)
[FileTransfer] Progress: 50% (4096/8192 bytes)
[FileTransfer] Progress: 75% (6144/8192 bytes)
[FileTransfer] Send complete: example.png (8192 bytes)
```

##  Architecture

### Ports

* **Main comms:** 8080, 8081, 8082, …
* **File transfer:** 9080, 9081, 9082, … (main + 1000)

### Components

1. **Node** – main node service
2. **MessageRouter** – message routing
3. **FileTransferService** – file transfer
4. **PeerConnection** – peer connection management

### Data Flow

```
Sender → file request → Receiver
Receiver → accept/decline → Sender
Sender → file byte stream → Receiver
```

##  Notes

### File Size Limit

* Current cap: **100 MB**
* Adjustable in code
* Large files take longer

### Network

* P2P connectivity must be healthy
* Firewalls may block transfer ports
* Prefer testing on the same LAN

### Security

* Verify the sender before accepting
* Be cautious with executables
* Scan received files with AV

##  Roadmap

### Short Term

* [ ] Resume (breakpoint) transfers
* [ ] Live transfer speed
* [ ] Batch file transfers
* [ ] Transfer history

### Long Term

* [ ] Encrypted file transport
* [ ] Compression for efficiency
* [ ] Cloud storage integration
* [ ] Mobile support

##  Testing

### Basic

1. Start two node instances
2. Connect the nodes
3. Send a small file (< 1 MB)
4. Verify file integrity

### Stress

1. Send a large file (near 100 MB)
2. Transfer multiple files concurrently
3. Test network interruption recovery
4. Run long-duration stability tests

---

** Congrats! Your P2P chat app now has complete file transfer support.**

You can now:

*  Truly send & receive files
*  See real-time progress
*  Choose the save location
*  Handle transfer errors gracefully
*  Transfer in both group and private chats
